                    The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I
                    thought
                    it
                    was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard
                    puritan
                    morals as one of the objects of the society.

            <p><cite>believed that Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism were traditions of Hinduism, with a shared history,
                rites
                and ideas. At other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about Buddhism other than his reading of
                Edwin Arnold's book on it. Based on that book, he considered Buddhism to be a reform movement and the
                Buddha
                to be a Hindu. He stated he knew Jainism much more, and he credited Jains to have profoundly
                influenced
                him. Sikhism, to Gandhi, was an integral part of Hinduism, in the form of another reform movement. Sikh
                and
                Buddhist leaders disagreed with Gandhi, a disagreement Gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.</cite> </p>
